  <title>Use cases</title>

  <para>This chapter will go over all the use-cases one by one in an attempt
  to describe them as clear as possible.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Use cases - Task management</title>

    <para>Within this paragraph all use-cases related to the referral business
    process are described.</para>

    <section>
      <title>General process information</title>

      <para>There are two processes which are combined in the
      application.</para>

      <para>The main process handles the tasks for the referral manager. It is
      started when a new referral is entered.</para>

      <para>The process starts by a review of the referral. The referral
      manager can correct some of the main fields, including the engagement
      level, completion deadline and the default e-mail address which should
      be used for notifications. </para>

      <para>If the referral manager indicated that the engagement level is 0 ,
      then the process finished by suggesting to send a level 0 notification.
      After that the process ends.</para>

      <para>If the engagement level was non-zero then the process splits in
      two parallel flows (indicated by the plus sign). At the top the
      "evaluate values" sub-process is called to evaluate the Ktunaxa values
      and notify the communities.</para>

      <para>The evaluate values block in the main process is handled by the
      evaluate values process.</para>

      <para>In this process the referral manager first determined the values
      to be investigated and the communities which need to be contacted. Then
      for each selected value an evaluator for that value needs to investigate
      the referral. Note the the "auto evaluate..." tasks are place holders
      for possible inclusion of business rules to do some evaluations
      automatically. For each community the community manager needs to inform
      the community and then collect the feedback from the community. The
      process finishes when all selected values and communities have been
      processed.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Managing comments</title>

      <para>When inspecting the different values in respect to a referral, it
      is possible to attach comments to the referral in question. Nevertheless
      not all comments are regarded as equal, since some of them can be
      attached to the final report, while others are there only to provide
      some extra feedback.</para>

      <para>When entering the comments view, the application will display the
      current list of comments attached to the referral, as seen in the image
      below:</para>

      <para><figure float="0">
          <title>Adding comments to a referral</title>

                <imagedata fileref="images/mockup/comment_overview.png"
                           format="PNG" width="100%" />
              </imageobject>

              </textobject>
            </mediaobject>
          </screenshot>
        </figure></para>

      <para>In the image above, the list consists of 2 comments. The first one
      has not been added to the report, while the second one is. As a result,
      different options will be available for both.</para>

      <para>As it can be difficult to navigate through large lists, the
      application will allow the user to sort and search/filter within the
      list. Sorting will be possible on the following attributes:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Author</emphasis>: The name of the author who wrote
          the original content. This does not have to be the same person who
          added the comment to the report.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Date</emphasis>: The time and date when the comment
          was originally created.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Title</emphasis>: The title of the comment.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Note also that a button is added to allow the user to add a new
      comment to the referral. By clicking on this button, the user will be
      presented the following view:</para>

      <para><figure float="0">
          <title>Adding a comment to a referral</title>

          <screenshot>
            <mediaobject>
              <imageobject>
                <imagedata fileref="images/mockup/comment_add.png"
                           format="PNG" width="100%" />
              </imageobject>

                <phrase></phrase>
              </textobject>
            </mediaobject>
          </screenshot>
        </figure></para>

      <para>When creating a new comment, the user has to fill in a title and
      an original content. He immediately has the option to add the comment to
      the report. The second text-area for the report-content will at first be
      disabled. Only when the user actually checks the "add to report" button,
      will this new text-are become available. At that time, the original
      contents will also be copied to the new field.</para>

      <para>If the comments is save, the application will bring the user back
      to the comments list view. From the list view, it is possible to edit an
      existing comment. If the comment has not yet been added to the report,
      the user can do this by clicking the "add to report" button, otherwise
      the user can click the "Edit comment" button. The application will then
      present the following view:</para>

      <para><figure float="0">
          <title>Changing an existing comment</title>

          <screenshot>
            <mediaobject>

                           format="PNG" width="100%" />
              </imageobject>

              <textobject>

              </textobject>
            </mediaobject>
          </screenshot>
        </figure></para>

      <para>The original content of a comment can only be changed by the
      original author of that comment. All other users are not allowed to do
      so. What can be changed is the contents that should be added to the
      report.</para>

      <para>If the original author of a comment decides to change the original
      contents, then the process of adding the comment to the report has to be
      done anew.</para>
